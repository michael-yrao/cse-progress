After a problem, **infer** the comfort rating yourself from what actually happened in the conversation, then state it as a proposal for the user to confirm or override. Do not ask an open "How did that feel — Clean, Shaky, or Blank?" when the transcript already answers it.

**Why:** the rubric is written down (CLAUDE.md) and I watched the whole attempt — I know how many hints I gave, whether they self-caught their bugs, and whether they could derive the approach. Making the user supply what I can already read is offloading work they shouldn't have to do.

**How to apply:**

Read the signal against the rubric:

| Signal in the conversation | Rating |
|---|---|
| Solved from blank page; no hints; I flagged no bugs (or only cosmetic ones they'd caught) | 🟢 Clean |
| Had the core approach but needed a nudge on a sub-part, OR I flagged a real bug they didn't self-catch | 🟡 Shaky |
| Couldn't derive the approach; needed it explained; the substantive fixes were all mine | 🔴 Blank |

Then **propose, don't interrogate**: "That reads as 🟡 Shaky — you had the sliding window but I flagged the inverted shrink condition. Confirm?" The user can override; their call is final (comfort is self-reported).

**Still confirm every time** — propose, wait for the yes/override, then log. Never log a rating silently.

**Rate the hint volume, not the excuse for it.** If I explained the algorithm — the data structure, the invariant, the "why this and not that" — then the approach was *supplied*, and that is 🔴 Blank by definition, no matter how reasonable it was that they didn't have it. A **first exposure to a new technique is still 🔴**: "there was nothing to recall yet" explains *why* it's Blank, it doesn't upgrade it. Deriving the problem-specific wrapper around a handed-over algorithm (e.g. on 743: "answer = max of the shortest distances", "`len(settled) == n` is the reachability test") is **not** deriving the approach — it's the easy half, and it doesn't lift 🔴 to 🟡.

The tell that I'm rationalizing: I list the substantive things I taught, and *then* argue for the higher rating anyway. If the list is non-empty, the rating follows the list. On 743 (Jul 13) I did exactly this — proposed 🟡 right after writing "I taught you Dijkstra" — and the user overruled to 🔴. That correction should never have been theirs to make.

Under-rating a fresh 🔴 as 🟡 isn't a harmless rounding: it sets the next review at +10 days instead of +2, so a technique that hasn't stuck at all gets two weeks to evaporate. The interval **is** the consequence of the rating.

## ⌨️ The learner codes without autocomplete, deliberately (Aug 9, 2026)

They write solutions **in the LeetCode editor with no autocomplete**, on purpose: *"it's easy to miss these
things as there is no auto complete, fits better with the google doc style interviews."* That is a
**deliberate fidelity choice**, the same instinct as whiteboard fidelity ([[feedback_whiteboard_fidelity]])
— practise under the conditions the interview actually imposes.

**What follows for rating:** when a flagged defect is a **transcription slip** — a duplicated line from a
copy-paste, a mistyped variable, a `>` for a `<` — the learner may reasonably read it as cosmetic and hold
🟢, and that is a defensible call rather than a soft one. **Still flag it plainly and still name it in the
proposal** (honesty over agreeableness is unchanged); just don't treat a typo as automatically equivalent
to a conceptual miss when they override.

**The distinction to actually apply:** did the error come from *not knowing the thing*, or from *typing the
thing*? A wrong loop bound derived from a wrong mental model is the former. Line 721:115 — `>` copy-pasted
where `<` belonged, in a union-by-rank block whose logic they could state correctly on sight — was the
latter. **Don't stretch this**: a slip that survives *because they never traced the branch* is a
verification gap, not a typo, and the tell is whether they recognize it instantly when shown.

Honesty matters more than agreeableness here: if they claim 🟢 but I supplied a real fix they missed, say so plainly (see the 355 and 36 exchanges) — then defer to their call. Related: [[feedback_no_spoilers]], [[feedback_phase_gated_blanks]] (which is the *one* case where a 🔴 doesn't get the Blank-interval loop — an un-taught technique, not a just-taught one).

## Local test findings are raised, then weighed — not automatic caps (Aug 16, 2026)

The coach runs a randomized harness against a reference on every rep. It sometimes finds things
**LeetCode's own test set misses** — Aug 16 produced two: 80 returned `k=2` for a one-element array
(legal input, `1 <= nums.length`), and 261 recursed 2000 deep (legal input, `n <= 2000`).

**The learner rates on LC pass/fail:** *"I go by LC pass and fail when I test so I will call this a pass."*
Offered three policies, they chose **keep raising findings and weigh them case by case** — not "stop
testing", and not "report as interview-prep only".

**How to apply:** report the finding with its evidence and say what it would cost in an interview, propose
the rating including it, and then **defer without re-arguing** if the learner discounts it. The finding
still lands in the ledgers as a record; only the comfort number is theirs. Same shape as the standing rule
in this file — honesty first, their call final.
