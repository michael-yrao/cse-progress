**Conceptually heavy topics get an active format, not an explanation.** The learner explicitly asked
for interactive methods (Jul 14 2026) after an explanation-only Redis thread left them more confused.

**What works (use these):**
1. **Derive-the-design** — pose the constraint, let them invent the mechanism, then name it.
   *"3 app servers, each with its own counter. User hits all 3. What breaks? Fix it."* → they invent
   shared state → **that's Redis.* Best format for "why does this exist."
2. **Failure-mode drill** — *"Redis just died. What happens to your rate limiter?"* Forces the tradeoff
   talk that interviewers actually probe. Strongest signal generator.
3. **Socratic pushback** — they explain it back; assistant plays the skeptical interviewer and asks
   the next "why" until it bottoms out. Exposes memorized-vs-understood instantly.
4. ~~**Cold blind sprint** (Recall Card)~~ — **retired Aug 13, 2026** with the study lanes. What measures SD now is a cold mock ([[project_sd_mock_model]]); the ladder above still governs **requested** teaching, which is the only teaching left on the SD track.

**What does NOT work (stop doing):**
- Escalating explanation essays. Correct detail without a skeleton = noise. See [[feedback-spine-first]].
- Answering a follow-up with more surface area than the question had.
- Tables/mechanisms/edge cases before the learner has stated the core idea back once.

**Why:** learner owns the thinking ([[feedback-operating-principles]]). An explanation makes them a
reader; a derivation makes them the designer. Recall Cards test retention *after* learning — they were
being used as the only tool, with prose as the teaching, and prose isn't teaching.

**How to apply:** on a 🔴 Blank concept, default to **derive-the-design first**, explanation only to
patch the specific gap they hit. Confirm the spine is stated back before adding any tactic.

## ⚠️ The floor: derive-the-design needs an existing model. At TRUE ZERO it fails. (Aug 8, 2026)

The ranking above is by *how much the learner produces*, and it is right **once a foundation exists.**
Below that it inverts: deriving asks the learner to **invent** a mechanism, which requires something to
reason from. At genuine zero there is nothing, and the format degrades into guessing.

**What happened:** networking, learner self-described as *"a complete novice."* Derive-the-design opened
with *"what problems would you have to solve?"* → *"I have no idea."* Retried with a concrete
postal-service analogy → *"I don't like this direction or method, let's start over."* Two failed attempts
before the format was abandoned.

**What worked instead — offer the choice, don't pick for them.** Four concrete approaches were put up
(spine-then-pull · bootstrap with an external explainer first · learn it inside a design · rewrite the
card). The learner chose **spine first, then I pull**, and it produced the best SD session in weeks:
IP → packets → headers → private/public → NAT → ports → the 4-tuple → DNS → how `443` is derived, every
step driven by their own next question, with several sharp catches of my own errors.

**So the rule is a ladder with a floor:**

| Learner's state on the topic | Opening format |
|---|---|
| Has a model, it's rusty or partial | **derive-the-design** (unchanged — still the default) |
| **True zero — no foundation at all** | **spine first (2–3 facts, ~5 lines), then let them pull.** Derivation becomes available *after* the spine lands |

**The tell you are below the floor:** the answer to your derivation prompt is *"I have no idea"* rather
than a wrong guess. **A wrong guess means there is a model to correct; a blank means there is nothing to
derive from** — switch to spine-then-pull immediately rather than reaching for a better analogy.

⚠️ **And check Bootstrap before assuming a topic has been taught at all.** *"A note exists"* is not
*"the learner has been taught"* — writing the card is the coach producing, not the learner learning. See
the Aug 8 entry in [[self_eval_log]] and [[feedback_spine_first]].

## ⚠️⚠️ Correction, same day (Aug 8, 2026, session 3): spine-then-pull is the learner's STANDING FORMAT, not a zero-state fallback

The floor rule above was written too narrowly and **immediately licensed the exact mistake it was meant
to prevent.** Having taught the TCP spine earlier in the day, I reasoned *"a model now exists, so the
ladder says derive-the-design is available again"* and opened the next segment with a derivation prompt.
The learner stopped it:

> *"I'm not a fan of teaching like this, let's go back to how we were doing this before. You give me
> small bits and I learn by asking questions about exactly how the small bits work, this should expand
> both the breadth and depth."*

**So the trigger is not the learner's knowledge level — it is the learner's preference, and it is
standing.** The ranking at the top of this file is a general default; **for this learner, on conceptual
SD/networking material, spine-then-pull is the format**, whether they are at zero or holding a partial
model. Do not "graduate" them back to derive-the-design because the prerequisite now exists.

**The format, precisely as they described it:**

1. **Give one small bit** — one mechanism, a few lines, complete in itself. Not a lecture, not a table,
   not the next three consequences pre-empted.
2. **Stop.** Do not ask them a quiz question and do not chain into the next bit.
3. **They ask about that bit.** Their question sets the direction — depth (*how does that actually
   work*) or breadth (*what about X*). Answer exactly what was asked, at the size it was asked.
4. Repeat.

**Why it works, in their words:** *"this should expand both the breadth and depth."* The pull direction
is theirs, so the session tracks what they can't yet see rather than what I predicted they'd need —
which is why it beat two attempts at derivation and produced the best SD session in weeks.

**The distinction that matters:** a Socratic question asks them to *produce the answer*; this format asks
them to *produce the question*. They are still doing the cognitive work — they own the direction, the
gap-finding, and the depth — but they are never asked to invent a mechanism they have no basis to invent.
Do not read "no derivation" as "back to explanation dumps": [[feedback_spine_first]] and
[[feedback_turn_economy]] still bind. **One bit per turn, then stop.**

**Where derive-the-design still belongs:** DSA reps and *design* sessions (lane ③), where the learner is
building the thing rather than learning what the thing is. This carve-out is about conceptual/plumbing
material.

## ✅ Confirmed by the learner Aug 9, 2026 — and the dependence on their questions is the POINT

Unprompted, next session: *"I quite like how we did networking yesterday. It is a lot more dependent on
the user's willingness to learn and ask questions but that should be the point as well since during an
interview and during actual design on the job, we should be asking a lot of questions."*

Two things follow, and the second is the one that changes behavior:

1. **The format is settled.** Spine-then-pull is confirmed by the learner after a full session under it.
   No further re-litigating, no drifting back to derivation on conceptual material.
2. **Its one apparent weakness — "it only works if they ask" — is a feature, not a risk to engineer
   around.** Requirement-gathering *is* the graded skill in an SD interview and the actual job. So the
   learner driving with questions is **rep on the interview skill itself**, running underneath the
   networking/SD content. Do not "de-risk" the format by pre-empting their questions, front-loading what
   they'd probably ask next, or filling a pause with more material — that removes the rep.

**How to apply:** when a pull stalls, hold the silence a beat rather than volunteering the next bit; if it
stays stalled, offer the *menu of directions* (breadth vs depth, two or three named branches) instead of
picking one and explaining it. A menu keeps the choice theirs. And treat the quality of their questions as
observable signal worth naming when it's good — the same way a strong clarifying question would land with
an interviewer.
