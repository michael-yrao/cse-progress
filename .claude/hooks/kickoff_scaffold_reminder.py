"""UserPromptSubmit hook: remind the agent that a kickoff greeting must scaffold the board.

Fires when the learner's prompt reads as a session KICKOFF ("let's do our sunday
session", "start saturday session", "/start-day", "what's up today") and injects a
reminder to scaffold the whole day's board BEFORE presenting it.

Why this exists
---------------
"A real kickoff scaffolds every problem on today's schedule before presenting the board"
used to live inline in the always-injected CLAUDE.md and fired every session. The
multi-skill migration demoted it into `references/scaffolding.md` — an opt-in read whose
open-trigger already presumes the decision to scaffold — so at a session-start greeting
the rule was never reached. It lapsed on "start saturday session" (Sep 12, 2026) and
again on "let's do our sunday session" (Sep 13). The Sep 12 fix was a note in that same
cold reference; it lasted one day.

This binds the rule to a MOMENT (the prompt) in a hot tier, the way
`scaffold_links_reminder.py` binds the links rule to a tool invocation. See the
2026-09-13 entry in `.claude/memory/self_eval_log.md` and `decisions.yml`
`kickoff-scaffold-gate`.

Warn-only: it injects context and never blocks. Costs no context tokens until it fires,
and stays silent on a named problem ("let's do 235"), a non-kickoff question ("what's
the bug in my code"), or a CLOSE-OUT ("close monday session", "wrap up and commit") —
a hook that cries wolf trains the agent to skim past it. The close-out guard was added
Sep 14, 2026 after "close monday session" tripped the `<weekday> session` pattern.

Second trigger, the SCOPED START (Oct 9/10, 2026): "doing 332 from tomorrow" took four
messages to land as a pull + scaffold. The coach overrode the script's announced session
date (Oct 9) with the wall-clock date (Oct 10, small hours), read the pull as a move to
Sunday, and did not scaffold on "doing 332" / "I am doing 332 right now". A prompt that
is neither a close-out nor a kickoff but names a problem number next to a do-verb now
injects a short reminder carrying the session date from `scripts/session_date.py`.
