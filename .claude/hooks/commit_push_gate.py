"""PreToolUse hook: deny a single Bash/PowerShell command that chains `git commit` and `git push`.

CLAUDE.md gate 8: in this repo commit and push are TWO commands, because the pre-commit
hook's output must be read between them -- an `ERROR:` line from a report-only check holds
the push. The rule lapsed as prose:
  - Sep 24, 2026: a chained commit+push shipped a stale `showcase.json`.
  - Oct 2, 2026: chained again, this time in a PowerShell call.

Mechanism: read the PreToolUse payload (`tool_name` Bash or PowerShell, `tool_input.command`).
Split the command into shell segments on `;`, `&&`, `||`, `|`, `(`, `{` and newline. A segment
counts only when, after leading whitespace, it STARTS with `git`, then optional flags
(`-C <path>`, `--flag`), then the subcommand. Deny, with the reason below, when some segment
is a commit and some segment is a push. So prose that merely names the subcommands (a commit
message containing "push", an echoed JSON payload, a heredoc sentence) does not match.
Knowingly not caught: an env-prefixed `FOO=1 git commit`, and a heredoc body line that itself
starts with `git commit`.

Leaves alone: a lone commit, a lone push, any other command, any other tool, and malformed or
non-JSON stdin (silence, exit 0). The deny shape mirrors `~/.claude/hooks/role_gate.py`
(`permissionDecision: "deny"` JSON on stdout, exit code 2), which was verified by a live probe.

Session-scoped on purpose: it also blocks a chained commit+push aimed at another repo from a
session opened here. No working-directory or repo detection. Stdlib only.
