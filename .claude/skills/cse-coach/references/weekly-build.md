# End-of-week close-out & schedule build

**The ordered procedure is the [`scheduling`](../../scheduling/SKILL.md) skill; this file is the
trigger and the why.** **Open this** when today is the last session of the week. **Not for** a mid-week rep (that's
`review-workflow.md`). **Not for** pricing a single day in progress (that's `effort-budget.md`
`--schedule-day`). The check is *"is today the last session of the week"* — **not** "does it feel
like a milestone". This was missed Aug 2, 2026, when a long session closed out on everything
*except* this.

**Archive + generate next week — both, in the same close-out, before the commit:**

```sh
git mv docs/foundations/schedules/<this-Mon>_schedule.md docs/foundations/schedules/archive/
# then write docs/foundations/schedules/<next-Mon>_schedule.md
```

Never one without the other. A week with no schedule file is not neutral. The weekly build is
where surplus is recomputed, the per-day load row is drawn (an aggregate is not a schedule). It
also reads `technique_coverage.md` to pick conversion reps. Skip it and next week runs off last
week's assumptions.

## The close-out checklist

- ⭐ **End-of-week complexity cleanup.** This was set Sep 3, 2026; the queue was widened to
  every rep's misses on 2026-09-23. Read the cleanup-queue table in
  [`complexity_gotchas.md`](docs/foundations/dsa/mastery/complexity_gotchas.md). This covers any
  missed Big-O, since the rating no longer considers complexity. For each queued problem, have the
  learner **re-open that code and re-state time + space cold, with the why**. No re-solving; only the
  bound. Clean → clear the row; missed again → keep it queued and escalate to a proper complexity
  teach on that category. An empty queue is a clean pass, not a skip.
- ⭐ **Cold complexity probes fire at the Sunday close-out**, NOT scattered across weekday warmups.
  This was consolidated Sep 20, 2026 — STANDING, learner's call. ~2 probes fire **cold on any mature 🟢/🎓
  solved problem** to keep the miss-cluster categories fresh. The learner states time + space cold on
  the existing code. **Disposable — only a MISS is carded** (probe ledger in `complexity_gotchas.md`); a
  repeated same-category miss escalates to a teach. **ALL complexity checks** now live in one
  focused block on Sunday. That block covers both these probes AND the cleanup queue above. The weekday
  boards carry none, so the daily tables stay lean and the learner meets complexity work in a single sitting.
- **Why the pull order is the technique comfort audit's** (`scripts/technique_comfort_audit.py`;
  the why-lines and the FUTURE block are hand-authored, the script names any gap).
  - **The "⚠️ Needs work" callout** at the top is the pull-order source. Priority:
    **🔴/🟡 conversions (zero-green list, weakest first) > overdue 🟢 cleans > thin-green fills +
    probes.** A zero-green technique outranks *discretionary* work and *fresh* cleans — but **not** a
    clean aged far past its interval (a retention risk that manufactures new demand). A 🔴 bills ~12×
    a 🟢 forever, so converting one removes the most demand.
- **Regenerate the company-demand report — `python scripts/company_demand.py --tier all`** (network;
  not a hook). Read its per-tier "demand vs supply" tables beside `technique_coverage.md`: a
  `NO FAMILY` verdict is a vocabulary gap (add the family to `techniques.yml`), a `not started`/`thin`
  family with high demand is a pull-order input, and the "asked by ≥3 targets and untracked" list is
  the pull population.
- **⚠️ Does the week contain a FIRST exposure to a named algorithm?** Then it carries a CONCEPT
  PRIMER, scheduled before that problem. ~15 min, unrated, no tracker row, ~1.0 unit. It covers
  the object being found and its name, and the nearest neighbouring object and the one feature
  that separates them. It also covers why the obvious approach is not enough, and stops there.
  **The first attempt lands at least a day later.** A primer measured in the same sitting
  measures nothing. What measures it is whether the recognition call fires. 332 cost five sessions
  because its first attempt WAS the introduction to Eulerian paths.
- **Unseen problems.** A problem seen 3+ times measures retention of that problem's solution, not
  the technique; unseen problems are the only test of recognition and transfer. New intake is
  `effort_budget.intake_per_week` problems, seated on the earliest days with room; a recognition
  probe and the mock are the week's other unseen rows; a day with no unseen row is fine
  (`scheduling`).
- **⚠️ Recompute any NUMERIC reason before renewing a deferral.** An item held because "surplus is
  −9.6" or "the board is full" expires silently the moment the number moves. Re-derive it, or
  restate the hold as a **state** condition (`green:Dijkstra`, `graduates:210`).
- **⚠️ Check every active phase has reps on the board.** (Found Aug 9, 2026: `Sliding Window +
  Stack` opened Aug 3 and sat a week with zero of its 8 problems in the tracker. It was invisible
  because the board was full of legitimate review work.)
- **Why a variant label is read from the tracker row.** Found Sep 18, 2026: one build tagged
  21/206/130 with the *other* variant in each case, which would have re-repped a graduated or
  not-yet-due variant. The board label is hand-authored, so verify it against the row (`scheduling`).
- **Why the integrity and phantom checks run on every build.** 2026-09-14: two overdue 🔴s crossed a
  week boundary and slipped consecutive builds, so a due row on no board is the "nothing dropped without
  a date" violation. A phantom row is one that discovery minted for a scaffolded, never-attempted
  file (self_eval 2026-08-31); a stranded probe sits outside `solutions.roots` (self_eval 2026-09-16). Steps: `scheduling`.
- **If the AI pillar is still PARKED, test its activation trigger** (see
  [`project_ai_pillar`](.claude/memory/project_ai_pillar.md)): DP/Backtracking phases closed AND
  `effort_budget.py` shows ≥2 days/week well under the ceiling for 2 weeks. Met → raise starting it
  with the learner; not met → say nothing. This is the firing mechanism that keeps "deferred" from
  becoming "forgotten" — don't skip it just because AI isn't on the board.
- **If the Practical Coding Rep is still PARKED, test its trigger** (see
  [`project_interview_formats`](.claude/memory/project_interview_formats.md)): career_strategy Gate
  1's DSA half holds AND the learner has said applications are opening. Met → raise building the
  drill with the learner; not met → say nothing.

## ⚙️ How the Sunday close-out is RUN (STANDING, set Sep 20, 2026 — learner's call)

The close-out follows the repo's **plan → execute → review** split, and runs under the global execution
workflow (`~/.claude/rules/execution-workflow.md`):

| Phase | Model | What |
|---|---|---|
| **Plan** | tech lead (the session) | price capacity, read the coverage / ⚠️-Needs-work callout, decide the pulls + day placement — the whole build *design*. Get learner approval. |
| **Execute** | tech lead + `engineer` agent (Sonnet) | the tech lead runs the archive `git mv` (the role gate denies state-changing git to engineers); the engineer writes the next-week file from the approved plan, runs the checker scripts, and reports the diff. The engineer leaves commit and push to the tech lead. |
| **Review** | tech lead (the session) | review the engineer's diff, then commit/push per the close-out authorization. |

The build is one engineer's worth of writeback — under the spawn rule (2:1) that means no team lead; the
tech lead supervises the engineer directly.

⭐ Never send the *planning* (judgement) or a *teach/rep* to the subagent — only the mechanical build
writeback. This is the deliberative-vs-mechanical register split (CLAUDE.md "Two registers").

Two standing passes ride every Sunday close-out:

- **⚠️ Self-eval meta-review + skill-update evaluation (Sunday, set Sep 20, 2026).** Run
  `python scripts/meta_review_digest.py` (one line per OPEN entry). For each open entry: resolved →
  consolidate it into `self_eval_archive.md`. Still live → decide whether it names a recurring miss
  that warrants a **skill / CLAUDE.md change** per the intervention ladder, and make that change
  **in this pass**. A self-eval that sits open for weeks is exactly the failure this pass exists to
  stop. Sunday is where the log gets drained and the skills get updated *because* of it, not just
  where entries pile up.
- **⚠️ Lean daily table — THE FORMAT.** This was set Sep 20, 2026, learner-approved; worked example:
  `docs/foundations/schedules/20260921_schedule.md`. The board must read **at a glance.** Columns are
  **`| Problem | S | E | Next | Technique |`**:
  - **Problem** — glyph prefix(es) + `[name](file) · [LC](url)` (a variant parenthetical stays, read from
    the tracker row per the variant rule above);
  - **S / E** — start / end comfort glyph; a 🟢 in **S** carries its streak going in (`🟢 s1`), which `effort_budget.py` prices from; **Next** — next-review glyph;
  - **Technique** — exactly **ONE word** (Backtracking · Dijkstra · Kruskal · Prefix-sum · …), nothing else.
  - **Row order** — within each day, problems run from highest priority to lowest: 🔴/🟡 conversions first, then new problems, then 🟢 reviews, with easy reviews last. A board shown to the learner keeps that order. `scripts/schedule_priority.py` applies this order, and the pre-commit hook runs it on a staged schedule.

  Three homes, so nothing is lost by leaving the table. *Rep rationale* ("was 🔴 Sep 10", "template
  writable cold?") goes to the mastery ledgers (`stuck_log.md` · `complexity_gotchas.md` ·
  `recognition_gotchas.md`). *Status* (protected / backfill / new / moved / variant / probe / primer)
  goes to the **glyph** per the Tags legend, never prose. *A build caveat that truly needs a
  sentence* goes to a compact **⚙️ Build notes** list below the table, keyed by problem #. Examples:
  a move + new date, an LC-premium mirror, a scaffold note. A Note column carrying prose is a
  **build defect** — trim it. ⚠️ A cold complexity/recognition re-ask that prints its own answer in
  the board is a **spoiler bug**. This was found Sep 20: the 226 row stated "O(n): invert visits
  every node" next to a *cold* re-ask. The answer stays in the ledger; only the problem and which
  bound go on the board. full rule: `decisions.yml` `eow-close-out-process-sep20`.

**Day order:** within each day, place **all DSA first, SD last**. The SD slot gets the open-ended
tail, so SD also absorbs any overrun. Spine-then-pull has no natural stopping point; bounded DSA
reps do. Never push SD to the next day unless the learner asks (a started design that moves
becomes unratable). full rule:
[`feedback_dsa_before_sd`](.claude/memory/feedback_dsa_before_sd.md).

**Minimum contents of the built week:** capacity/surplus arithmetic · per-day load row · daily
table · protected reps · backlog/slip list (nothing dropped without a date or an explicit "no date
exists") · SD slots (placed, never priced — see `effort-budget.md`) · end-of-week targets ·
next-week preview · concept primers.

## The build procedure

The ordered steps (sweep, demand, forecast, pull order, content rules, pricing each day with its row
line, headers, the checkers, practice specs, the preview and the carried section), the row cap, the
carry rule and the intake backstop are the [`scheduling`](../../scheduling/SKILL.md) skill. Pricing
is the `effort-units` skill; budget policy is `effort-budget.md`. Coverage / which technique to pull:
`technique-coverage.md`.
