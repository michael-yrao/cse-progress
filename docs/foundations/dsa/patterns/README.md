# Patterns

Two ways in, one source of truth:

- **`techniques/`** — the actual content. Each file is **one atomic technique**: recognition signal → template → key facts → practice ladder (NC150 flagged) → pitfalls. This is where you learn the move.
- **`data-structures/`** — **hub pages**, not content. Each says "for this kind of data, here are the techniques you reach for," linking into `techniques/`. Use these when you know the *shape* of the data but not the move.
- **`intuition_cheatsheet.md`** — recognition tables + single-trick techniques (Boyer-Moore, cyclic sort, two heaps, quickselect). Start here when you don't know what a problem wants.
- **[`../fundamentals/complexity/big_o.md`](../fundamentals/complexity/big_o.md)** — time/space complexity of every technique + data structure here, in one table.

Rule of thumb: **know the move → open a technique. Know the shape → open a hub. Know neither → cheatsheet.** Techniques are never duplicated; hubs only link.

## By data structure (the "shape" lens)

| Hub | Techniques it points to |
|-----|-------------------------|
| [linked_list](data-structures/linked_list.md) | dummy_node · fast_slow_pointer · in_place_reversal · recursion |
| [tree](data-structures/tree.md) | tree_dfs · tree_bfs · recursion · memoization |
| [graph](data-structures/graph.md) | union_find · topological_sort · BFS/DFS traversal |
| [array_string](data-structures/array_string.md) | two_pointer · sliding_window · prefix_sum · binary_search · monotonic_stack |
| [stack_queue](data-structures/stack_queue.md) | monotonic_stack · monotonic_deque · plain stack · BFS queue |

## By technique (the "move" lens — A→Z)

## Graph algorithms — the name index (added Aug 5, 2026)

**Why this is its own section:** the A→Z table above answers *"I see this shape, what's the move?"*
This one answers the reverse — **"what does this name actually solve?"** — because the advanced graph
algorithms are the ones whose *names* don't stick. A name you can't retrieve is a technique you can't
reach for cold, and recognition is one of the two phase-exit axes.

Each row **stands alone on purpose** — no "same as above", no "likewise". This gets read one row at a
time, weeks apart, and a row starting with "same" has nothing to point at.

| Algorithm | Solves | Note |
|---|---|---|
| **Dijkstra** | cheapest path from one source to everywhere, when every edge cost is non-negative | ⚠️ not written |
| **Bellman-Ford** | cheapest path from one source to everywhere, tolerating negative edge costs; works in rounds, so the number of edges used can be capped | ⚠️ not written |
| **Floyd-Warshall** | the cheapest path between *every* pair of nodes at once, by repeatedly asking whether routing through one more allowed midpoint beats the best cost known so far | [floyd_warshall](techniques/floyd_warshall.md) |
| **Prim's** | connect every node into one network for the least total edge cost, growing a single tree outward from a start node | [prims_mst](techniques/prims_mst.md) |
| **Kruskal's** | connect every node into one network for the least total edge cost, taking edges cheapest-first and skipping any that closes a cycle | ⚠️ not written |
| **Hierholzer** | find a walk that uses every edge in the graph exactly once | ⚠️ not written |
| **Topological sort** | order the nodes so that every node comes after everything it depends on | [topological_sort](techniques/topological_sort.md) |

**The shape of the list — three questions, two answers each.** Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford answer *"what's
the cheapest way to get there."* Prim's and Kruskal's answer *"what's the cheapest way to connect
everything."* Hierholzer and topological sort aren't about cost at all — they answer *"in what order do I
walk this."* Each pair differs by one condition; the picking features are in
[recognition_patterns.md](../recognition_patterns.md).

**Floyd-Warshall is the one with no partner**, and that *is* its recognition signal. Dijkstra and
Bellman-Ford answer the cheapest-path question **from one source**; Floyd-Warshall answers it **between every
pair**, which is a different question and not a loop around the other two. The trigger is a problem that needs
distances it never names a source for — *"for each city, how many others are within…"* — plus a small `n`
(≤ ~400), because the cost is O(n³) and that bound is what makes it affordable.

The **⚠️ not written** marks double as the gap list — four of these seven have no technique note, and
Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra are both gate-relevant before Aug 16.

> ✅ **Floyd-Warshall's row filled Aug 5, 2026** at 1334's close-out, as planned — the rated measurement half
> of the Jul 31 teach. **The recognition half of that rep landed: the algorithm was named cold from "all pairs
> + small n" before any code.** Execution did not — 1334 came back 🟡 (adjacency map instead of the n×n matrix),
> so Floyd-Warshall still holds **zero 🟢** going into the Aug 16 gate.
