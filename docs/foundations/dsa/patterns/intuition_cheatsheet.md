# Intuition Cheatsheet

Fast triage: scan the **signal** column for a clue that matches your problem, then jump to the technique — or walk the [decision tree](#decision-tree) below, shape first. Use this when you don't yet know what a problem wants. (Know the move → open a [technique](techniques/) directly; know the data shape → open a [hub](data-structures/).)

## Signal → technique

| What you see in the prompt | Reach for | Doc |
|----------------------------|-----------|-----|
| **Sorted** array + "find a pair/triple summing to target" | two pointers (converge from ends) | [two_pointer](techniques/two_pointer.md) |

| Linked list: "**reverse**", reorder, palindrome | in-place reversal | [in_place_reversal](techniques/in_place_reversal.md) |
| Linked list: head may change (insert/delete at front, merge) | dummy node | [dummy_node](techniques/dummy_node.md) |
| "**Connected?**", "how many groups/components", cycle in an **undirected** graph | union-find | [union_find](techniques/union_find.md) |

| Tree property that **depends on children** (height, balanced, diameter) | DFS postorder | [tree_dfs](techniques/tree_dfs.md) |
| **BST** "sorted output" or "validate" | DFS inorder | [tree_dfs](techniques/tree_dfs.md) |
| "**All** subsets / permutations / combinations", "find every way" | backtracking | [backtracking](techniques/backtracking.md) |
| Overlapping subproblems / "min/max/count ways" with optimal substructure | DP (memoization) | [memoization](techniques/memoization.md) |
| "**Kth largest / smallest**", "top k", "k closest" | heap | [big_o](../fundamentals/big_o.md) |
| "**Majority** element" (> n/2 or > n/3) | Boyer-Moore voting | *below* |
| Array of `1..n`, find the **missing / duplicate** | cyclic sort | *below* |
| "**Running median**" of a stream | two heaps | *below* |
| "Kth largest" and you want O(n) average, no full sort | quickselect | *below* |

When totally stuck: **can I sort?** If the answer is a count, order doesn't matter, validity is monotonic, or brute force is O(n²) — sorting often unlocks two-pointer / binary-search / greedy.

## Decision tree

The same triage as the table above, ordered the way the recognition gate asks it: **shape first,
then the cue, then the technique.** Walk down; every leaf is a technique.

- What is the **shape** of the input?
  - Array / string
    - Sorted — or can you sort it?
      - Pair/triple summing to a target → [two pointers](techniques/two_pointer.md) (converge from ends)
      - "Smallest/largest x that works", or find a position → [binary search](techniques/binary_search.md) (min/max boundary)
    - "Contiguous subarray/substring" + a constraint (≤ k distinct, sum, longest/shortest) → [sliding window](techniques/sliding_window.md)
    - "Subarray sums to k" / many range-sum queries → [prefix sum](techniques/prefix_sum.md) (+ hashmap)
    - "Next greater/smaller", spans, histogram, temperatures → [monotonic stack](techniques/monotonic_stack.md)
    - "Max/min in every window of size k" → [monotonic deque](techniques/monotonic_stack.md)
    - Values are `1..n`, find the missing / duplicate → **cyclic sort**
    - "Majority element" (> n/2 or > n/3) → **Boyer-Moore voting**
    - "Kth largest / smallest", "top k", "k closest"
      - O(n log k) is fine → **heap**
      - want O(n) average, no full sort → **quickselect**
  - Intervals
    - "Merge/insert overlapping" (the answer is a set) → [sort by start, sweep](techniques/intervals.md)
    - "Max that fit" / "min to remove" / "min arrows" (the answer is a number) → [sort by end, greedy frontier](techniques/intervals.md)
  - Linked list
    - "Cycle?", "middle", find the duplicate number → [fast & slow pointers](techniques/fast_slow_pointer.md)
    - "Reverse", reorder, palindrome → [in-place reversal](techniques/in_place_reversal.md)
    - Head may change (insert/delete at front, merge) → [dummy node](techniques/dummy_node.md)
  - Tree
    - Property that depends on children (height, balanced, diameter) → [DFS postorder](techniques/tree_dfs.md)
    - BST "sorted output" or "validate" → [DFS inorder](techniques/tree_dfs.md)
    - "Level by level" / shortest # of steps → [BFS](techniques/tree_bfs.md)
  - Graph (edges, a grid, or "connected?")
    - "Connected?", how many groups/components, cycle in an **undirected** graph → [union-find](techniques/union_find.md)
    - "Prerequisites", ordering, "can you finish" (a DAG) → [topological sort](techniques/topological_sort.md)
    - Shortest path — are the edges weighted?
      - unweighted / uniform cost → [BFS](techniques/tree_bfs.md)
      - weighted, non-negative → **Dijkstra**
      - negative weights, or ≤ k hops → **Bellman-Ford**
      - every pair of nodes → [Floyd-Warshall](techniques/floyd_warshall.md)
    - Cheapest way to connect every node (MST) → [Prim's](techniques/prims_mst.md)
  - A stream (values arrive one at a time)
    - "Running median" → **two heaps**
  - No structure stands out — what is the **ask**?
    - "All" subsets / permutations / combinations, "find every way" → [backtracking](techniques/backtracking.md)
    - Min / max / count ways, with overlapping subproblems → [DP](techniques/memoization.md) (memoization)

## Single-trick techniques (recall by name)

Each is one clever idea, not a broad pattern — no dedicated doc; memorize the trigger and the trick.

| Technique | Trigger | The trick | Problems |
|-----------|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Boyer-Moore voting** | Majority element (> n/2, or > n/3) | Keep `candidate` + `count`; ++ on match, -- on mismatch, swap candidate at 0 — the majority survives cancellation. For > n/3, track **two** candidates. Re-verify at the end. | 169, 229 |
| **Cyclic sort** | Array holds `1..n`; find missing/duplicate | Swap each value to its home index (`nums[i]` → index `nums[i]-1`). The first index where `nums[i] != i+1` is the answer. O(n) / O(1). | 268, 287, 41 |
| **Two heaps** | Running median / balance a stream around the middle | Max-heap for the lower half, min-heap for the upper half; keep sizes within 1. Median = the top(s). | 295 |
| **Quickselect** | Kth largest/smallest without a full sort | Partition like quicksort, but recurse into **one** side only. O(n) average, O(1) extra. | 215 |
