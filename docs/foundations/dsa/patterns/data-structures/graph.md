# Graph — Technique Hub

Nodes + edges, represented as an adjacency map/list (or an implicit grid). This page maps graph problems to the techniques you reach for.

## Structure facts

- Represent as `adj = defaultdict(list)`; **undirected = add both directions**.
- Grids are implicit graphs: cell `(r,c)` neighbors are up/down/left/right.
- Track `visited` (nodes, not (node,parent) pairs) to avoid re-processing / infinite loops.

## Techniques used on graphs

| Technique | Reach for it when | Doc |
|---|---|---|
| **BFS / DFS traversal** | Reachability, components, flood fill, shortest # of edges (BFS) | see [tree_bfs](../techniques/tree_bfs.md) / [tree_dfs](../techniques/tree_dfs.md) (same idea + a `visited` set) |
| **Union-Find** | Connectivity, grouping, cycle detection (undirected) | [techniques/union_find](../techniques/union_find.md) |
| **Topological sort** | Ordering with dependencies on a DAG | [techniques/topological_sort](../techniques/topological_sort.md) |

| **Dijkstra** | Single-source shortest path, **weighted non-negative** edges (uniform weights → BFS; negative / k-hop → Bellman-Ford) | min-heap (lazy) or array-scan on dense small n |
| **Floyd-Warshall** | **All-pairs** shortest path on a small n (~≤ 100–400) | [techniques/floyd_warshall](../techniques/floyd_warshall.md) |
| **MST (Prim's / Kruskal's)** | Cheapest set of edges connecting everything — **undirected only** | [techniques/prims_mst](../techniques/prims_mst.md) |

## Deciding fast

| Question | Technique |
|---|---|
| How many connected components? | Union-Find, or BFS/DFS flood fill |
| Is there a cycle (undirected)? | Union-Find (union of already-connected = cycle) |
| Valid tree? | Union-Find + `edges == n-1` connectivity check |
| Order tasks with prerequisites? | Topological sort (Kahn's / DFS) |
| Shortest # of steps in a grid/graph? | BFS (multi-source BFS if many starts, e.g. rotting oranges) |
| Shortest **weighted** path from one source? | Dijkstra (non-negative). ⚠️ **Undirected is NOT a cue against it** — an undirected edge is two directed edges of the same weight; add both directions and run it unchanged (2026-09-25, from 1334) |
| Shortest paths between **every** pair? | Floyd-Warshall on small n; n × Dijkstra on a large sparse graph (early-stop past a threshold) |
| Connect everything at minimum total cost? | MST — Prim's / Kruskal's. **Here undirected IS the cue**: a spanning tree is only defined on undirected graphs |
