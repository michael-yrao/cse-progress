"""Tests for technique_coverage.py — the `queued:` key on a `problems:` spec (Sep 26, 2026).

Stdlib unittest, matching test_gamify.py's convention (no pytest in this repo). String
fixtures only: a tiny techniques.yml + a tiny dsa_progress.md, written to temp files with
the module's own path constants monkeypatched — never the live repo files. Run it with:

    python scripts/test_technique_coverage.py

Pins the `queued:` key added alongside the Prim's/Kruskal's split and the Bellman-Ford
external-judge siblings: a `problems:` spec with no matching tracker row and a `queued:`
trigger is reported as a known gap (the Gaps cell + the Action list), never silently
folded into "declared, not queued"; a `queued:` on a spec that DOES match a row is a no-op;
an unqueued unreached spec is still counted AND listed; and the rendered `## Coverage`
table still round-trips through gamify.parse_techniques() with the right `problems` list,
`thin` flag, and no false `hasVariantGap`.
