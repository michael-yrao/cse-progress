"""Price a study day in effort units instead of counting problems.

The daily cap used to be an integer: "at most N problems." That cannot tell a
five-minute 🟢 Easy from a 🔴 Hard, so three days in the same week were all "7
problems" while measuring 5.5, 8.0 and 10.5 units of actual work. Every weekly
schedule note reading "Saturday is the heaviest day by some margin" was a human
correcting for that by hand, in prose, one week at a time.

This script is the source fix for that: it prints the number, so the number does
not have to be remembered or re-derived. Per the intervention ladder in
.claude/memory/feedback_self_evaluation.md — a tool that emits the right value
outranks a rule that asks someone to compute it.

    units = base(comfort, streak) × difficulty(tier, demoted?) × attempt_factor
            (weights and the three familiarity layers live in cse.config.yml; the
             flat comfort_units × difficulty was the pre-Sep-3-2026 form)

Usage:
    python scripts/effort_budget.py                     # demand, floor, ceiling, due queue
    python scripts/effort_budget.py --schedule-day      # today, AS BUILT (done vs left)
    python scripts/effort_budget.py --schedule-day 2026-08-18
    python scripts/effort_budget.py --day 19 110 42     # price a HYPOTHETICAL day
    python scripts/effort_budget.py --day 269 560       # (--sd is retired: SD is unpriced)
    python scripts/effort_budget.py --due 2026-08-08    # what is due on a date, priced
