"""Resolve the *session* date, which past midnight is not the wall-clock date.

Why this module exists
----------------------
A study session that starts at 22:00 and runs to 01:00 is **one session with one date**
— its start date. Every date-touching script here defaulted to `datetime.now()`, so past
midnight they all silently rolled to the next day. That mis-stamped attempt methods,
tracker rows, and whole schedule boards; `feedback_session_dating` recorded four-plus
occurrences and recurred three times *after* being promoted to a memory file, because a
memory file cannot fix a default that lives in the tool.

The detection rule is the one already written in CLAUDE.md, now executable:

    "past midnight, check `git log --date=iso` — commits from minutes ago mean a
     *live session*, not a new day."

`restore_history.py` solved the same problem from a different signal (the dated stubs in
the stashed files). That signal is better when it exists — it reads the session's own
artifacts — but it only exists once files have been touched. Git history works before
anything has been written, which is what scaffolding needs.

Design note: the override flag is `--date`, and it is an **override**, not the mechanism.
A flag that must be remembered is just a paragraph with a CLI; the default has to be
right on its own.

#   1. In a past-midnight session the last commit is often ALSO past midnight, so it
#      carries the rolled-over date — the signal is polluted by the very bug being
#      fixed. Never test "was the commit yesterday?", only "was it recent?".
#   2. This repo batches commits to session end (feedback_batch_commits), so for most
#      of a session the newest commit is the PREVIOUS session's close-out, 24h+ back.
# Hence the primary signal below is the dirty working tree, not this.
