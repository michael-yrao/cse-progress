"""The two propagation misses that are actually possible: a rated rep whose schedule row was
never completed, and a rated rep whose row was never struck.

CLAUDE.md's **Schedule Integrity Rule** ends with *"the spaced repetition dates are the source of
truth; the weekly schedules must reflect them."* This checks that the CURRENT week's schedule file
reflects what the tracker says happened — nothing more.

## ⚠️ What this deliberately does NOT check, and why

The first version of this script enforced the rule's broadest reading — *every* computed next-review
date must appear in some schedule file — and reported **73 of 115 rows on a healthy repo**. That is
not a finding, it is a broken instrument: the rule cannot mean that, because a 🟢 s2 landing in
February 2027 has no week file, no preview, and no business having one. **Distant dates are handled by
the weekly build's own tracker sweep** (*"FIRST do a full tracker sweep for ALL problems with
next_review_date ≤ end of that week"*), which is a pull, not a push. Pre-placing them would be
duplicate bookkeeping that rots.

So this script checks only the window where a *push* is genuinely owed: the week being worked.

## The six checks (four move `--check`, two are report-only)

| | Miss | Why it is invisible without this |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | A **struck-through** row with an empty `End` or `Next` cell | the row reads as done, the tracker is correct, and only the schedule is short a fact — nothing downstream notices |
| **2** | A tracker row **attempted during this week** whose number is **not struck** in the file | the rep happened and the board still advertises it as pending; the next kickoff re-offers a problem that was already done |
| **3** | A tracker row **due on or before this week's Sunday** seated on **no day** of the built board | the weekly build's own sweep silently dropped an overdue rep; the 2026-09-14 leak (84, 547) crossed a week boundary and slipped two builds |
| **4** | A day-header label or the week's **Goal** paragraph **names** a problem that appears on **no row** anywhere in the week's Daily Schedule | build prose promised a rep no row carried; the 2026-09-14 (78 Subsets) and 2026-09-20 (1102/1631 Dijkstra) misses both had this shape |

Check 3 also reads the `## ⏭️ Carried to next week (row cap)` section: a due row named there counts
as seated only when it is proven (`effort_budget.is_unproven`); an unproven one is flagged.
Two more checks are **report-only** (printed after the findings, never moving `--check`):
**5** a day block over `max_rows_per_day`; **6** the week's 🆕 row count differs from
`intake_per_week` (zero when the unproven-overdue backstop is triggered).

**An em-dash, `unrated`, or `✅` in a cell is intentional, not missing.** Teaches, primers and probes
are unrated by design and legitimately carry no comfort and no date, so only a genuinely **empty**
cell is reported. A checker that flags deliberate blanks gets ignored within a week.

**Check 4's known false-positive shapes, recorded rather than chased.** `PROSE_NUMBER` is tuned
against real weeks, not proven correct — it can still misread `12 🟡 conversions` (a REP COUNT, not
a problem, followed by a comfort glyph) or `by December 2026, the` (four digits immediately before a
comma) as a genuine mention. Check 4 is report-only, so a rare false positive there costs a manual
glance, not a silent miss. **The obvious-looking fix — intersect a candidate with the tracker's known
LC numbers — does NOT work and should not be attempted:** a 🆕 intake is untracked BY DEFINITION (its
whole point is that it has no tracker row yet), so that filter would drop every genuine new-intake
mention while still admitting a tracked date/count number that happens to match a real problem's LC
number.

    # on the board, and this failure is a row that is on NO board at all. The weekly build's

    # sunday, so it is not flagged; a deliberate deferral gets a new future date, so it is not
    # flagged either — only a genuinely-dropped due row surfaces. Reuses effort_budget's row
