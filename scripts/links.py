"""Emit the `[file] · [LC/NC]` link pair for one or more problems — the SOURCE FIX for
the link rule outside a scaffold.

`new_problem.py` already prints a `LINKS:` line on every scaffold, and that case has not
lapsed since Aug 3, 2026. The kickoff / restate / hand-over / "what's next" cases have no
such tool, so their links get hand-authored — and the dominant failure is TRANSCRIPTION:
copying a path out of a schedule row, which stores `../../../dsa/...` (correct relative to
that file, three folders deep) but DEAD when the chat renderer resolves it from the repo
root. That is the Aug 27, 2026 lapse (self_eval_log.md).

This tool removes the transcription. Give it problem numbers; it prints one
`[<number> <title>](<repo-root-relative path>) · [<judge label>](<url>)` line per number
(`LC`, `NC`, `Kattis`, `CSES`, `HelloInterview`, or another judge's bare hostname — see
`judge_label`), reading the path from disk and the title/URL from the file's own
docstring header (falling back to the tracker). The agent runs it and pastes the
output — it is structurally
impossible to emit a wrong path.

Per the intervention ladder in `.claude/memory/feedback_self_evaluation.md`:
source fix > hook > CLAUDE.md step > memory file. This is the top rung, matching
`new_problem.py`'s `report_links()`; the Stop hook `problem_link_reminder.py` is the backup.
