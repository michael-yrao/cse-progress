"""Surface reps whose comfort could not be reconstructed from the weekly schedules, so
the learner can fix the SOURCE (a schedule's End glyph) going forward instead of living
with a hollow "(pre-archive rep)" activity dot on the Problems-tab timeline chart.

gamify.py's build_problems() already does the reconstruction (and carries the docstring
promise to never fabricate a comfort) — this script REUSES it rather than re-deriving the
same logic, and adds the one thing build_problems() does not report on its own: WHY a
point came back null.

## Two very different reasons a point is null

| | Cause | Fixable? |
|---|---|---|
| **expected** | the problem number has more than one tracker row (method variants — 21 Recursion vs Iterative, 323's three variants). The schedule index is keyed by NUMBER, not variant, so gamify.py deliberately degrades every non-final point to null rather than guess which variant a rep belonged to. | No — correct, permanent behaviour, not a gap. |
| **gap** | a single-variant problem's rep date has no matching entry in ANY schedule file (live or archive) — usually a week whose file never recorded that day's End glyph. | Yes — go back and fill in that week's schedule End cell. |

Only the second kind is a "gap" this script reports. (The FINAL point of every timeline
always anchors to the tracker's current comfort regardless of cause — see
gamify.build_problems — so a gap can only ever appear on a non-final rep.)

Usage:
    python scripts/check_timeline_gaps.py            # print the report, exit 0
    python scripts/check_timeline_gaps.py --check     # exit 1 if any real gap exists
