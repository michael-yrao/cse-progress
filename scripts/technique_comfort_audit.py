"""Weekly technique-comfort audit — the technique-keyed progression view.

`technique_coverage.md` answers "where are the GAPS" (no-green / thin / variant). This answers
a different question the learner asked for (2026-08-22): **"what is my overall comfort per
technique, and why"** — a standing progression view, refreshed at each weekly build, that also
looks FORWARD to algorithms not yet started.

Division of labour, by design:
  - The COMFORT + COVERAGE columns are GENERATED here, rolled up from the tracker via the same
    join `technique_coverage.py` uses (imported, not reimplemented). Comfort = the technique's
    demonstrated ceiling (`best_comfort`); coverage tempers it with problem/green counts, and the
    why-line carries the nuance a single emoji cannot.
  - The WHY column is HAND-AUTHORED by the coach and PRESERVED across regens, keyed by technique
    name. A technique newly appearing in the tracker is added with an empty why for the coach to
    fill (it prints a reminder naming them).
  - The FUTURE section (roadmap algorithms not yet started) is entirely hand-authored and
    preserved VERBATIM between the FUTURE markers — the phase-plan table in study_guide.md is its
    reference, but mapping a future PHASE to its ALGORITHMS is a judgement, not a parse.

Run at the weekly build (step 7), not from the pre-commit hook — this is a weekly artifact and
churning it every commit would fight the preserved narrative:

    python scripts/technique_comfort_audit.py            # rewrite, preserving why + future
    python scripts/technique_comfort_audit.py --check    # exit 1 if the generated columns are stale
