"""Which rule files have not been read against the decisions that postdate them.

Why a DATE and not a dependency list
------------------------------------
The first design for this was `depends_on: [effort_budget.ceiling, ...]` in every rule file,
inverted into a concept index. It was abandoned for a reason visible in this repo's own
history: **every detector built out of WORDS has already failed here.**

  - `RETIRED_TERMS` only catches spellings it was handed. It had `daily_cap` and not
    "daily cap", so eight live instances of a superseded rule went unflagged — including
    "5. **5-Problem Daily Cap**: Never exceed 5 problems in a day" sitting in the study
    guide's own protocol list.
  - the restated-value check matches the CURRENT config value, so a line asserting a STALE
    one (`ceiling 9.0`) is invisible to it by construction.

A dependency list is more words, and would have failed the same way: the rule that broke
worst (`feedback_unseen_on_non_sd_days`) rested on "an SD day costs 3.0 units" — a premise
its author would never have thought to declare, because at the time it was simply true.

**A date cannot be misspelled, and every file already needs one.** So this check starts
COMPLETE: a file with no `reconciled` field is reported as unreconciled rather than skipped,
which means nothing can be silently absent. That property is the whole argument.

⚠️ Why `reconciled:` is a field and not `git log -1`
----------------------------------------------------
Git mtime measures "was edited", not "was re-examined against the new decision". A typo fix
would have stamped `feedback_unseen_on_non_sd_days` current on the day it was the most
broken file in the repo. Bumping this field is a deliberate assertion — *"I read this rule
against that decision, and it is either still right or now fixed."* Automating it from git
would restore exactly the silence this exists to break.

⚠️ This does not remove the audit work. It makes it visible and tracked instead of
invisible, which was the actual failure — nobody knew the backlog existed.
