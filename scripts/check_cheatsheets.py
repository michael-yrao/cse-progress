"""Validate the technique docs (+ intuition_cheatsheet.md) against the /learn cheat-sheet
markdown contract that scripts/build_cheatsheets.py reads (see the plan's "The markdown
contract" section: docs/cse-coach/learn_cheatsheet_plan.md).

    python scripts/check_cheatsheets.py             # report
    python scripts/check_cheatsheets.py --check      # exit 1 on a hard contract violation

Reuses build_cheatsheets.py's own parser (imported, never duplicated — the parser is the
arbiter of the contract, per the plan). Six hard checks:

  1. a technique doc missing a required heading (When to reach for it / Picking feature /
     Common pitfalls / Practice / at least one Template: …);
  2. a Template section whose python fence has no valid `Complexity: … ` line right after it;
  3. a Practice section that resolves to zero key problems;
  4. an intuition_cheatsheet.md signal row whose Doc column links `techniques/<x>.md` for
     an `<x>` that doesn't actually exist as a file.
  5. the `## Decision tree` section: missing entirely, a malformed/dangling bullet (the
     parser's own `problems`), a root that is itself a leaf, an inner node with no
     children, or a linked leaf whose `techniques/<stem>.md` doesn't exist.
  6. coverage: every `signals[].reach` (the table) must appear as a decision-tree leaf
     `reach` — a table row with no leaf is a finding.

A row/bullet that does NOT link a technique page is a LABEL (heap, Boyer-Moore voting, …)
and is always allowed — there is no hardcoded label list; "is it a label" is simply "did the
Doc/notWhen resolution find a real file", derived fresh from the table/doc each run, per the
plan. Blocking from the pre-commit hook as of Sep 23, 2026 — all 18 docs passed, so
`--check` is wired to fail the commit on a violation (see the plan).
