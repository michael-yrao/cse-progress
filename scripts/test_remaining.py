"""Tests for remaining.py's ROW_NUMBER — the regex behind the "what's left" board.

Stdlib unittest, same style as test_gamify.py: a small fixture file in a temp dir, read
through unstruck_numbers() rather than asserting on the regex object directly, so a
future rewrite of ROW_NUMBER only breaks this file if the observable output changes.
