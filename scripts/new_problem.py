"""Scaffold a solution file for a problem — the "set up before I start" action.

Creates an empty, dated skeleton so the file is ready before the learner codes.
NEW problem  -> create <root>/<pattern>/<number>_<snake>.py with an Attempt 1 banner.
RETRY (file exists) -> insert an `Attempt · <today>` banner + stub at the TOP of the
Solution class and MOVE everything below it (the prior attempts) into a per-problem stash
at <root>/.history/<number>_<snake>.txt, leaving a one-line pointer in the file.

The retry stub goes first, not last, so opening the file lands on a blank page rather
than on the previous solution — reading your own prior answer before a retry destroys
the rep. The prior attempts are physically absent from the file while you work, so no
editor/extension is needed to hide them (portable to any editor, GitHub, plain diff).
scripts/restore_history.py pastes them back at session end, reconstructing the single
file with full dated history — unless the attempt was never made, in which case the
stash stays out so the file remains a blank page for next time.

It writes NO solution logic and NO data-structure classes — only the scaffold
(respects the whiteboard-fidelity + no-code-edits rules).

The learner never pastes the problem statement — the coach fills it in (auto-fetched
from the problem source, or a token-lean compressed version in low-token mode).

Usage:
    python scripts/new_problem.py --number 1 --title "Two Sum" --pattern arrays_and_hash \
        [--url https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/] [--method twoSum] [--premium]
