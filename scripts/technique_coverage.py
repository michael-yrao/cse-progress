"""Generate the DSA technique-coverage report.

The spaced-repetition tracker (`dsa_progress.md`) is keyed by **problem**. That is the
right key for scheduling reviews and the wrong key for answering "do I actually know
topological sort?" — a question about a *technique*, which is spread across several
problems and sometimes several methods of the same problem.

This script joins a hand-authored technique vocabulary (`techniques.yml`) against the
tracker and emits `technique_coverage.md`, one row per technique, with three gap checks:

  no-green   no problem for this technique has ever come back 🟢 — a phase-exit blocker
             under the per-algorithm exit rule (recognition + execution, >=1 🟢 each)
  thin       fewer problems than the computed coverage threshold (`cse.config.yml`'s
             `coverage_threshold`: a floor sized off the technique's own declared problem
             count, plus its still-🔴/🟡 problems) — a technique needs more than one
             surface form before it is a skill rather than recall of one problem's solution
  variant    a declared method variant with zero problems behind it (the Kahn's-vs-DFS
             case that prompted this tool). Variants already sitting in the Waiting Room
             or Expansion Queue are marked `queued:` in the YAML and reported separately,
             so a known gap never masquerades as a new finding.

It also reports **unmapped** tracker rows. That is the anti-drift guard: a newly solved
problem shows up as unmapped until someone assigns it a technique, so the vocabulary
cannot silently fall behind the tracker the way method parentheticals do.

`techniques.yml` ships as a curriculum-wide vocabulary, so on a young tracker most of the
problems it names are simply **not solved yet**. That is the expected state, not a
finding — so an unmatched spec is split three ways: no tracker row for that number, but
the `problems:` entry itself carries a `queued: <trigger>` (same vocabulary as a
`variants:` queue) is **queued** — a known gap, named in the Action list and the Gaps
cell rather than re-reported as new; no tracker row and no `queued:` key is **declared,
not queued** (counted AND listed, so a thin technique's open slots are visible, not just
their number); a row that exists but whose *method* string doesn't match is real
**drift** and is listed. Without that split a fresh repo opens with a hundred-line
"problem" list and the report stops being read.

Usage:
    python scripts/technique_coverage.py            # write the report
    python scripts/technique_coverage.py --check    # exit 1 if the report is stale
