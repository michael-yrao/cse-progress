"""Generate the company-demand report: what target companies ask, mapped onto techniques.

`pull_interview.py` answers "what can I pull next, gated by what I already know". This
answers a different question: **what do the target companies ask most, which technique
family does each problem belong to, and how much of that demand does the tracker already
cover?** Same source data (the liquidslr company-wise CSVs), a different join — against
`techniques.yml` families instead of the milestone-category gate — and a different output
shape: one report per company tier (`career_strategy.md` §2), then a cross-tier "asked by
several targets and still untracked" list.

Run by hand — it needs the network for anything but `--local` — so this is NOT wired into
the pre-commit hook (unlike `technique_coverage.py`, which only reads local files).

Usage:
    python scripts/company_demand.py --tier all
    python scripts/company_demand.py --tier fintech --window 3mo --top 50
    python scripts/company_demand.py --company Google,Meta --top 30
    python scripts/company_demand.py --local scripts/fixtures/company_demand_sample.csv --stdout

Stdlib only, plus PyYAML via `technique_coverage._load_yaml()` (already a repo-wide
dependency, auto-installed there).
