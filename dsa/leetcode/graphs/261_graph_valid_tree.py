"""
Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]]

Output:
true

Example 2:

Input:
n = 5
edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3], [1, 4]]

Output:
false

Note:

    You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.

Constraints:

    1 <= n <= 100
    0 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2
